# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Task Management App (MERN Stack)

This project is a Task Management application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js).

## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:
	Clone the repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
Replace `<repository-url>` with the URL of the Git repository.

	Server Setup
1. Navigate to the server directory:
 cd server
2. Initialize npm (if package.json doesn't exist):
  npm init -y
3. Install dependencies:
   npm install dotenv express mongodb nodemon cors bcrypt jsonwebtoken 
4. Setup dotenv file:
   Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory and add your MongoDB connection URI and port:
   MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/todosdb
   PORT=5000
Replace `MONGODB_URI` with your MongoDB connection string and `PORT` with your desired server port.
5. Start the server:
   npm start
This will start the server using nodemon, which will automatically restart the server when changes are made.

	Client Setup
1. Navigate to the client directory:
  cd client
2. Install dependencies:
   npm install
3. Start the React development server:
  npm start
	MONGODB Setup

Setting up MongoDB Atlas involves creating a cloud-hosted MongoDB database service that you can connect to from your application. Below are the steps to set up MongoDB Atlas:
Step-by-Step Guide to Set Up MongoDB Atlas
1.	Sign Up and Log In to MongoDB Atlas:
o	Go to the MongoDB Atlas website.
o	Click on "Start Free" or "Try Free" to create an account if you don't have one already.
o	Follow the steps to sign up and log in to MongoDB Atlas.
2.	Create a New Project:
o	Once logged in, click on "Build a New Cluster" or "Create a New Cluster" to start setting up your database.
o	You will be prompted to create a new project. Give your project a name (e.g., "TaskManager") and click "Next".
3.	Configure Cluster Options:
o	Choose a cloud provider (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, Azure) and a region where you want your database to be hosted.
o	Choose a cluster tier. For development purposes, the free tier (M0 Sandbox) is often sufficient.
o	Configure additional options such as cluster name, auto-scaling, backup options, etc.
o	Click "Create Cluster" to start provisioning your MongoDB cluster.
4.	Wait for Cluster Deployment:
o	MongoDB Atlas will now create and deploy your cluster. This may take a few minutes.
5.	Whitelist Your IP Address:
o	Once the cluster is deployed, navigate to the "Network Access" tab under "Security" in your MongoDB Atlas dashboard.
o	Click on "Add IP Address" and then "Add Current IP Address" to whitelist your current IP address. This allows your application to connect to the MongoDB cluster.
o	Optionally, you can add a different IP address range or allow access from anywhere (0.0.0.0/0). Ensure this is done securely according to your application's requirements.
6.	Create a Database User:
o	Navigate to the "Database Access" tab under "Security" in your MongoDB Atlas dashboard.
o	Click on "Add New Database User".
o	Create a username and password for your database user. Remember these credentials as you will need them to connect your application to MongoDB Atlas.
o	Assign appropriate privileges to the user (e.g., read and write to any database or specific databases).
7.	Connect Your Application:
o	Once your cluster is ready and your database user is set up, navigate to the "Clusters" tab in your MongoDB Atlas dashboard.
o	Click on "Connect" for your cluster.
o	Choose "Connect Your Application".
o	Copy the connection string provided. It should look something like this:
mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.your-cluster-url.mongodb.net/<dbname>?retryWrites=true&w=majority


Note: Replace <username>, <password>, and <dbname> with your database username, password, and the name of the database you want to connect to.
8.	Set Up dotenv File (Optional):
o	In your Node.js application (server-side), create a .env file if you haven't already.
o	Add your MongoDB Atlas connection string and other environment variables
MONGODB_URI=mongodb+srv://<username>:<password>@cluster0.your-cluster-url.mongodb.net/<dbname>

9.	Start Using MongoDB Atlas:
o	Update your Node.js application to use the MongoDB Atlas connection string.
o	Start your application and ensure it connects to MongoDB Atlas successfully.
o	You can now use MongoDB Atlas for storing and retrieving data in your application.

Additional Tips:
•	Security: Always use strong passwords and follow best practices for securing your MongoDB Atlas database and application.
•	Scalability: MongoDB Atlas provides options for scaling your cluster as your application grows. Review and adjust your cluster settings based on your application's performance and scaling needs.
•	Monitoring and Alerts: Utilize MongoDB Atlas monitoring tools to monitor your database performance and set up alerts for any anomalies or issues.
By following these steps, you'll be able to set up MongoDB Atlas for your MERN stack application and start leveraging the power and scalability of MongoDB in the cloud.
